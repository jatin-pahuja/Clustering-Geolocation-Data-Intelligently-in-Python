# Clustering-Geolocation-Data-Intelligently-in-Python
We have taxi rank locations, and want to define key clusters of these taxis where we can build service stations for all taxis operating in that region.

## Prerequisites
- Basic Matplotlib skills for plotting 2-D data clearly.
- Basic understanding of Pandas and how to use it for data manipulation.
- The concepts behind clustering algorithms, although we will go through this throughout the project.
